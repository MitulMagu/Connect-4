The eval function is explained in this document.

The function first checks the number of 4 in a rows for each player horizontally by incrementing fours1 for player 1 and fours2 for player 2..
It then checks for 3 in a rows with blank in 1st place, 2nd place, 3rd place and 4th place respectively by incrementing threes1 for player 1 and threes2 for player 2.
It will now check for 2 in a rows with -
	1. 1st and 2nd column blank
	2. 2nd and 3rd column blank
	3. 3rd and 4th column blank
	4. 1st and 4th column blank
	5. 2nd and 4th column blank
	6. 1st and 3rd column blank
It will increment twos1 for player 1 and twos2 for player 2.

The function will repeat the process for vertical and diagonal directions in the same manner.

Finally, it will give weights (1 for four in a rows, 0.5 for three in a rows and 0.25 for 2 in a rows)
If AI is player 1, weights for player one are positive and player two are negative and then both are added.
If AI is player 2, weights for player two are positive and player one are negative and then both are added.
The result is then returned.
